The purpose of this report is to identify common topics in undergraduate and master’s theses across departments within the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education at Sanata Dharma University. To achieve this, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of theses from the years 2022 and 2023. The analysis utilized data consisting of thesis titles, which were subsequently coded to generate a list of keywords for each thesis.

Our analyses yielded three key insights. First, we examined the frequency of keywords across departments, providing an overview of common topics within the faculty and within individual departments. Second, we analyzed the connections between keywords through a network perspective, offering insights into how topics are interrelated and identifying clusters of related topics. Third, we explored the connections between keywords and departments to assess the extent of interdepartmental linkages.

```{r}
df_tugasakhir <- read_excel("fkip_tugasakhir_22-23.xlsx")
df_tugasakhir <- df_tugasakhir |> 
  mutate(
    DE = str_replace(DE, "pedagogi ignasian", "pedagogi reflektif"),
    DE = str_replace(DE, "paradigma pedagogi reflektif", "pedagogi reflektif"),
    DE = str_replace(DE, "pendekatan saintifik", "saintifik"),
    DE = str_replace(DE, "penguatan profil pelajar pancasila", "p3_pancasila"),
    DE = str_replace(DE, "profil pelajar pancasila", "p3_pancasila"),
    DE = str_replace(DE, "pelajar pancasila", "p3_pancasila"),
    ID = str_replace(ID, "pedagogi ignasian", "pedagogi reflektif"),
    ID = str_replace(ID, "paradigma pedagogi reflektif", "pedagogi reflektif"),
    ID = str_replace(ID, "pendekatan saintifik", "saintifik"),
    ID = str_replace(ID, "penguatan profil pelajar pancasila", "p3_pancasila"),

## Keyword Frequency Across Departments

```{r}
dep_keywords <- df_tugasakhir |> 
  select(C1, ID) |> 
  rename(
    department = C1,
    keywords = ID
  ) |> 
  separate_longer_delim(
    cols = keywords,
    delim = "; "
  )

keywords_count <- dep_keywords |> 
  select(keywords) |> 
  group_by(keywords) |> 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(count))
```

The table below presents the keywords and their frequencies. It shows that the top ten most common keywords in the students' theses are "modul", "media", "hasil belajar", "LKPD", "persepsi", "pembelajaran berbasis projek", "problem based learning", "film", "modul ajar", and "motivasi belajar".

The table below presents the degree, weighted degree, and betweenness centrality of each node in the bipartite network. The degree indicates the number of direct connections each node has, while the weighted degree adjusts this count to account for the strength of the connections. Betweenness centrality reflects the extent to which a node serves as a bridge between other nodes, highlighting its role in facilitating connections across the network.

```{r}
prodi_keywords_metrics <- read_csv(
  "prodi_keywords_metrics.csv",
  show_col_types = FALSE
)
prodi_keywords_metrics_simple <- prodi_keywords_metrics |> 
  select(Id, nodetype, Degree, `Weighted Degree`, betweenesscentrality) |> 
  mutate(
    `Weighted Degree` = round(`Weighted Degree`, 2),
    betweenesscentrality = round(betweenesscentrality, 2)
  ) |> 
  arrange(desc(betweenesscentrality))
prodi_keywords_metrics_simple |> 
  datatable(
    rownames = FALSE,
    colnames = c("Node", "Node type", "Degree", "Weighted degree", "Centrality")
  )
```

The table below shows each keyword along with the number of departments it is associated with and the list of departments. This provides insight into the extent to which certain keywords are shared across different departments.

prodi_connection <- read_csv(
  "prodi_connection.csv",
  show_col_types = FALSE
)
prodi_connection_simple <- prodi_connection |> 
  select(Source, Target, Weight)
chordDiagramFromDataFrame(
  prodi_connection_simple,
  scale = TRUE
)
```

@fig-connection-matrix offers a detailed representation of the connections between departments, complementing the chord diagram in @fig-dep-connection. While the chord diagram emphasizes the overall network structure and connection strength, the heatmap highlights the exact weights of shared keywords between department pairs. Each tile corresponds to a department pair, with darker shades indicating stronger connections. Numerical values within the tiles provide precise weights, facilitating a closer examination of thematic linkages across departments.
