    "text": "The purpose of this report is to identify common topics in undergraduate and master’s theses across departments within the Faculty of Teacher Training and Education at Sanata Dharma University. To achieve this, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of theses from the years 2022 and 2023. The analysis utilized data consisting of thesis titles, which were subsequently coded to generate a list of keywords for each thesis.\nOur analyses yielded three key insights. First, we examined the frequency of keywords across departments, providing an overview of common topics within the faculty and within individual departments. Second, we analyzed the connections between keywords through a network perspective, offering insights into how topics are interrelated and identifying clusters of related topics. Third, we explored the connections between keywords and departments to assess the extent of interdepartmental linkages."

The weighted degree reflects the number of connections each keyword has, adjusted for the strength of those connections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 visualizes the relationship between centrality (the importance or influence of a theme) and density (the development and cohesion of a theme) across different clusters. The plot divides the space into four key categories. Motor themes (high centrality and high density) are well-developed, important themes that are central to the research field. Basic themes (high centrality but low density) represent widely connected themes that are fundamental but may lack depth or development. Niche themes (low centrality but high density) are highly specialized, well-developed themes that are not central to the main field. Emerging or declining themes (low centrality and low density) indicate topics that are either emerging and developing or losing relevance.\n\n\n\n\ndata = FileAttachment(\"cluster_metrics_all.csv\").csv({ typed: true }) // Load your dataset into Observable JS\n\n// Create dropdown for department selection\nviewof department_selector = Inputs.select(\n  [...new Set(data.map(d =&gt; d.department))], // Get unique departments\n  {label: \"Department:\", value: \"PGSD\"}\n)\n\n// Filter data based on department selection\nfiltered_data = data.filter(d =&gt; d.department === department_selector)\n\n// Create scatterplot\nPlot.plot({\n  marks: [\n      Plot.dot(filtered_data,\n         {x: \"centrality_std\",\n          y: \"density_std\",\n          fill: \"cluster\",\n          opacity: 1,\n          r: (d) =&gt; d.size * 4\n          }),\n          // Add horizontal line at y = 0\n      Plot.ruleY([0], {stroke: \"black\", strokeWidth: 1, strokeDasharray: \"4,4\"}),\n      // Add vertical line at x = 0\n      Plot.ruleX([0], {stroke: \"black\", strokeWidth: 1, strokeDasharray: \"4,4\"}),\n      Plot.tip(filtered_data, Plot.pointer({\n      x: \"centrality_std\",\n      y: \"density_std\",\n      title: (d) =&gt; [d.cluster_title, d.sample_members].join(\"\\n\\n\")\n    }))\n      ],\n  symbol: {legend: false},\n  color: {\n    type: \"categorical\",\n    scheme: \"Set1\"\n  },\n  x: {label: \"Centrality\", fontSize: 18},\n  y: {label: \"Density\", fontSize: 18},\n  style: {fontsize: 18},\n  grid: true\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Interactive scatterplot of centrality vs density, with filtering by department."

    "text": "3 Interdepartmental Linkages Based on Keywords\nFigure 4 displays the connections between departments and keywords, illustrating how different academic disciplines relate to various research topics. The size of the nodes represents the weighted degree, indicating the strength of each node’s connections. The color of the nodes differentiates the types of nodes: departments are represented in green, while keywords are represented in pink, visually distinguishing the two types of entities in the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Bipartite network graph illustrating the connections between departments and keywords, highlighting the relationships between academic disciplines and research topics.\n\n\n\nThe table below presents the degree, weighted degree, and betweenness centrality of each node in the bipartite network. The degree indicates the number of direct connections each node has, while the weighted degree adjusts this count to account for the strength of the connections. Betweenness centrality reflects the extent to which a node serves as a bridge between other nodes, highlighting its role in facilitating connections across the network.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows each keyword along with the number of departments it is associated with and the list of departments. This provides insight into the extent to which certain keywords are shared across different departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the connections between departments based on the shared keywords in their theses. Each link between two departments represents a shared keyword, and the thickness of the link indicates the strength of the connection, with thicker links showing a higher number of shared keywords. This visualization highlights how departments are interconnected through common research topics, helping to identify areas of overlap and potential collaboration within the faculty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Chord diagram illustrating the connections between departments\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 offers a detailed representation of the connections between departments, complementing the chord diagram in Figure 5. While the chord diagram emphasizes the overall network structure and connection strength, the heatmap highlights the exact weights of shared keywords between department pairs. Each tile corresponds to a department pair, with darker shades indicating stronger connections. Numerical values within the tiles provide precise weights, facilitating a closer examination of thematic linkages across departments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Heatmap showing the connection strength between department pairs"
